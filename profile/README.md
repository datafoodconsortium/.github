## Welcome to the DFC developer space ðŸ‘‹

You have reach the entry point to start working on the [Data Food Consortium project](https://www.datafoodconsortium.org/). Here you will find all our technical information and resources. All of our work is open source and we are happy to get new contributions ðŸ¤“.

You can chat with us on our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T3CKZMVGR/).

The consortium is meeting every week on Thursday morning. We alternate between a global coordination meeting and an ontology dedicated meeting. Contact us on [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T3CKZMVGR/) or by [email](mailto:hello@datafoodconsortium.org) if you want to join.
